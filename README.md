# Mission-to-Mars
### Module 10 of Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Overview
This project focused on scraping data from the web, storing that data in a mongodb, and pulling that data from our mongodb to be displayed on a flask web application. The goal of this web application is to be able to scrape data at any given time directly from the application so that the web application would reflect the most up-to-date information, as well as some high quality photos of Mars and a table comprised of facts about Mars. We also modified our html code within the app to display our scrape button in red and italicized the "Mars Hemispheres" title just for kicks. Most of our code was written in python, however we did make some edits to our index.html document using html.

# Mission-to-Mars
### Module 10 of Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Overview
This project focused on scraping data from the web, storing that data in a mongodb, and pulling that data from our mongodb to be displayed on a flask web application. The goal of this web application is to be able to scrape data at any given time so that the web application would reflect the most up-to-date information, as well as some high quality photos of Mars and a table comprised of facts about Mars. Most of our code was written in python, however we did make some edits to our index.html document using html.
